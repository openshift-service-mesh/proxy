// Implementation of ThreadManager, which is effectively an auto-sizing
// threadpool with an arbitrary number of feeder queues that may have limits
// or may be unbounded.

// Each ThreadManager instance is composed of a few independent pools to avoid
// lock contention.  Work (Closures) is given to one of these pools arbitrarily.

// Closures are given to the ThreadManager by a ManagedQueue. No more than N
// closures from a given ManagedQueue will be allowed to run in the
// ThreadManager at any given moment, where N is configurable for each
// ManagedQueue. Max queue size and watchdog timeout are also configurable for
// individual queues.

// A single overseer thread for the address space oversees all ThreadManager
// instances.  It is responsible for creating new threads and killing old ones
// (e.g., if they become idle for long periods). The overseer is created when
// the first ThreadManager is used, and never dies; there is never more than one
// in the process.  Worker threads are never moved from one pool to another
// (except by killing one and starting another).

// The overseer invokes ThreadManagerPolicy objects to determine if the
// number of threads should be increased or decreased. This is indicated in the
// ThreadManagerAction object returned by a policy. The ThreadManagerAction
// also affects the time between policy invocations, as specified by delay_ms.

// Data structures:
// ThreadManager::Rep
//   The internal representation of a ThreadManager. It contains one or more
//   (and always a power of 2) TMPools.   All existing ThreadManager::Reps
//   are references by the vector tm_vec so they can be found and managed
//   by a single overseer thread.
// TMPool
//   An independent thread pool, with a queue of work and a pool of threads
//   that automatically shrinks and grows.
// TMThread
//   Represents a thread in a pool.
// ManagedQueue::Rep
//   The internal representation of a ManagedQueue. It points to the
//   ThreadManager::Rep, and sends work to it.  It has a queue of work
//   (possibly of finite size) that holds work that cannot be given to a pool
//   because the ThreadManager is running too many threads on behalf of
//   this queue already.
// TMWork
//   An item of work (a closure) plus a pointer to the queue it was given to.
//   This is the unit that is queued in TMPool.
