#define THIRD_PARTY_GLOOP_THREAD_THREAD_MANAGER_H_
// ThreadManager maintains a collection of threads; work may be given to
// the threads by different queues (which are Executors).   The queues may
// be configured to limit the threads that will be applied to the queue's
// work, the length of the queue, and the time the closures on the queue
// may run for.
//
// ThreadManager creates threads as needed to meet demand; there is no hard
// upper bound except for bound set on particular queues.  It delays thread
// creation more when many threads have been created.  It deletes threads only
// when they have been left idle for several seconds.
// Closures presented to the threads will be run as soon as possible.  Closures
// may run in any order; there is no attempt to maintain FIFO ordering.

// The default stack size for ThreadManager threads is 64k.  You are strongly
// encouraged to make your stacks fit within that limit.  ThreadManager is
// intended to be a default choice for clients that wish not to have to tune
// threadpools.  If you wish to tune your threadpools, use another
// implementation.

// For production monitoring of ThreadManager, see:
//   //gloop/thread/thread_manager_streamz.cc

// EXPECTED USE:
//  Most programs can use just one ThreadManager, the default one returned
//  by thread::DefaultManager().
//  A program that uses multiple kernel priorities might use
//  a ThreadManager for each priority.
//
//  For closures that will run for bounded time and arrive at bounded rate,
//  simply Schedule() the closures on a default ManagedQueue, which you might
//  obtain using:
//    thread::ManagedQueue *q = thread::DefaultQueue();
//  For example, if a closure performs an RPC that will either run in 10ms or
//  time out in 30s, simply Schedule() it on *q.
//
//  For closures that may take unbounded time, such as those that will hang
//  forever if they attempt to contact a service that is down (such as GFS
//  calls), you should add them via a queue with bounded limits.
//  For example:
//    thread::ManagedQueueOptions q_options;
//    q_options.thread_limit = 8;
//    q_options.queue_limit = 100;
//    thread::ManagedQueue *gfs_q = thread_manager->NewQueue("GFS", q_options);
//  You might also use a bounded-limit queue when an outside entity (perhaps
//  malicious) may generate an unbounded number of closures of a particular
//  type.  For example, you might use a bounded queue for each active user, or
//  for each active IP subnet.
//
// To avoid deadlock, it is important never to queue closure that may block
// waiting (perhaps transitively) for another closure on the same queue if the
// number of threads that may service the queue is bounded.
