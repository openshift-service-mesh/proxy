      Thread name prefixes may contain only the characters a-z, A-Z,

      information about thread naming guidelines and the use of thread

      The actual runtime thread is not created until "Start" is called.
      Start cannot be called from this constructor because the started thread
      would then race with initialization of any subclasses of Thread.

      To more easily pass the options argument to the constructor, you
      can use the fact that the thread::Options setter methods return
      a reference to *this and combine settings:

        MyThread() : Thread(thread::Options().set_stack_size(1024 * 1024).

/** The PeriodicThread class is usually part of another class that

    Example:

        class MyClass {
         public:
          MyClass() : write_thread_(this), read_thread_(this) { }

          PeriodicThread<MyClass> write_thread_, read_thread_;

        c.write_thread_.Signal(true);
        ...
        c.write_thread_.Exit();
        </pre>

    You can also use a Google permanent callback of type Callback1<Thread*>
    if you don't want to bother with defining your own class.

    Example:
    <p>
        <pre>
        void MyFunction(Thread* thr) { }
        ...
        Callback1<Thread*>* cb = NewPermanentCallback(&MyFunction);

        PeriodicThread<Callback1<Thread*> > thread(cb);
        ...
        thread.Signal(true);
        ...
        thread.Exit();
        </pre>

    Finally, you can use a Google permanent closure which accepts no parameters.

    Example:
    <p>
        <pre>
        void MyFunction() { }
        ...
        Closure* c = NewPermanentCallback(&MyFunction);

        PeriodicThread<Closure> thread(c);
        ...
        thread.Signal(true);
        ...
        thread.Exit();
