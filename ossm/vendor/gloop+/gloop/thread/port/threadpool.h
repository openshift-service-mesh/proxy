// An implementation of google3 ThreadPool using POSIX threads (pthreads).
// The implementation is *not* feature-parity. It only provides a subset of
// the functionality of the google3 implementation.
//
// - The pool allocates a fixed number of worker threads on instantiation.
// - The worker threads will pick up work jobs as they arrive.
// - If all workers are busy, work jobs are queued for later execution.
//
// The thread pool is shut down when the pool is destroyed.
//
// Example usage of the thread pool:
//   {
//     ThreadPool pool(4);
//     for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {  // Dispatch 100 jobs.
//       pool.Add(NewCallback(MyFunction, my_data));
//     }
//   } // ThreadPool gets destroyed only when all jobs are done.
