// PeriodicClosure will periodically call the given closure with a specified
// period in a background thread.  After Start() returns, the thread is
// guaranteed to have started and after Stop() returns, the thread is
// guaranteed to be stopped. Start()/Stop() may be called more than once; each
// pair of calls will result in a new thread being created and subsequently
// destroyed.
//
// PeriodicClosure runs the closure as soon as any previous run both is
// complete and was started more than "interval" earlier.  Thus, runs are
// both serialized, and normally have a period of "interval" if no run
// exceeds the time. The first invocation of the closure happens immediately
// upon running Start(), unless a startup delay has been configured.
//
// Note that, if the closure takes longer than two intervals to finish, then
// PeriodicClosure will "skip" at least one call to the closure.  For
// instance, if the period is 50ms and the closure starts runs at time 0 for
// 150ms, then the closure will immediately start executing again at time 150,
// but there will be no closure runs corresponding to times 50 or 100.  This
// is especially important to remember when using a simulated clock: advancing
// simulated time atomically over N intervals will not cause the closure to be
// called N times.
//
// This object is thread-safe.
//
// Example:
//
//   class Foo {
//    public:
//     Foo() : periodic_closure_([this]() { Bar(); },
//                               absl::Seconds(1)) {
//       periodic_closure_.Start();
//     }
//
//     ~Foo() {
//       periodic_closure_.Stop();
//     }
//
//    private:
//     void Bar() { ... }

//     PeriodicClosure periodic_closure_;
