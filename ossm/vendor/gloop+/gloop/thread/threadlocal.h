// A ThreadLocal<Type> object provides a per-thread instance of Type.
// The Type instance is created for a thread on first access in that thread,
// like, when get() or pointer() is called.
//
// For example, you can use the following to keep track of per-thread stats.
//
//      static ThreadLocal<int64> counter;
//
//      void SomeFunction() {
//        counter.set(counter.get() + 1);
//        ...;
//      }
//
// Please note that since C++11, the recommended way to implement a thread-local
// variable is the thread_local keyword (see <link> and
// <link>).
//
// Caveats:
// (a) It is often very convenient to declare a global "ThreadLocal<T>"
//     object.  Be warned that C++ initialization order for global
//     objects is non-deterministic, and therefore you should not access
//     such a global object until after main() has started.
//     Note: ThreadLocal has an exception to the style guide rules for global
//     variables with regards to destruction. The rules for initialization
//     must still be followed for the type contained within the ThreadLocal.
//
// (b) get/set/pointer operations typically take 50 cycles
//     (18ns on 2.8 GHz machine)
//
// (c) Each per-thread instance value of a ThreadLocal<T> is always
//     initialized via default construction or copy construction.
//     When T is a primitive type default construction means 0-initialization.
//
// (d) As long as ThreadLocal<T> objects are default-constructed and
//     changed only via pointer() method,
//     T does not have to have a copy constructor
//     or assignment operator publicly defined.
//     Thus, one can e.g. create ThreadLocal<std::unique_ptr<T>>
//     to have thread-local pointers that own and deallocate
//     the objects they refer to.
//
// (e) ThreadLocal<T> objects do proper cleanup for the thread-local instances
//     of objects of type T:
//     - T's destructor for the thread-local instances in all threads
//       is called when a ThreadLocal<T> object is destroyed
//     - Ti's destructors for all thread-local instances of all
//       ThreadLocal<Ti> for a given thread are called when the thread exits
//       or soon after. (If an iteration via ForEachUnlocked is in progress, the
//       destructor will not run until after the loop has completed)
//     Thus if the used T owns (is responsible for) some data on the heap
//     or other resources it's important to define T's destructor
//     to do appropriate cleanup.
//     I.e. replacing ThreadLocal<Foo*> with ThreadLocal<std::unique_ptr<Foo>>
//     will in many cases eliminate memory leaks without any adverse effects.
//     Exception: if ThreadLocal<T> is a global object, no destructors will be
//     run on process exit.
//
// (f) It is not safe to access ThreadLocal objects from within a signal
//     handler.  If you need to access a thread-local static from within a
//     signal handler, consider the safe_pointer() method on the
//     STATIC_THREAD_LOCAL family of constructs from
//     https://github.com/abseil/gloop/tree/main/gloop/base/static_threadlocal.h.
//
// (g) Interfaces such as Executors and Fibers do not guarantee that the
//     underlying threads are replaced or reinitialized between operations.
//     Callers may not depend on ThreadLocal objects being in a newly
//     constructed state. For example, after a fiber completes, a subsequently
//     executed fiber might reuse the thread it had been allocated and observe
//     'left-over' thread-local state. This caveat applies to all thread-local
//     storage implementations.
