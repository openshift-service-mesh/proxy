// On supported platforms, StackReclaimer allows the reclaim of pages allocated
// by the operating system to back stack frames which are no longer being used.
// This reclaimation is not exhaustive; the goal is that sufficient memory is
// allocated that typical future stack growth will not actually result in new
// memory being assigned (e.g. via demand paging, linked stack, or other).  We
// call this the "working size".
//
// This is intended for interfaces which maintain internal thread pools (such as
// Fibers and Executors) to reclaim memory from idle threads; particularly when
// execution does not commonly require a deep stack.
//
// Example usage:
//    StackReclaimer reclaimer;
//
//    while (have_more_requests) {
//      ... execute next request ...
//
//
//      // Automatically reclaim allocated stack memory in excess of the
//      // "working size".  This does not prevent this stack space from
//      // reallocated in the future.
//      reclaimer.ReduceMemoryUsage();

  // The implementation reserves the right to adjust this working size
