// A Fiber is a light-weight thread.  It supports cancellations, deadlines,
// priorities, etc.  A typical use is that a Fiber is created when an RPC
// arrives at a server, and the RPC is considered finished when the fiber stops
// running.
//
// Fibers are arranged in a tree.  E.g., when an RPC handler needs to
// run several computations (or sub-RPCs) in parallel, it should
// create a set of child fibers and run the sub-computations in those
// child fibers. It must Join() them before it finishes.
//
//   void ServerHandler(...) {
//     thread::Fiber worker1([] { ... });  // Lambdas work great.
//     thread::Fiber worker2(BindFront(SubComputation, ...));
//     worker1.Join();
//     worker2.Join();
//   }
//
// Note that ServerHandler() itself is running within some fiber and the two
// fibers (worker1 and worker2) are created as children of that fiber.
//
// Methods on the same fiber can be safely called concurrently from multiple
// threads (any exceptions will be documented on a per-method basis).
//
// Cancellations
// -------------
// A fiber can be cancelled.  The cancellation is automatically
// propagated to all descendants of the fiber.  I.e., sub-computations
// are also cancelled.  This cancellation should be considered a
// request to the code to stop quickly.  Nothing is killed
// automatically; it is up to the cancelled code to detect the
// cancellation and stop doing what it was doing.
//
// Example:
//    // Start a child fiber and cancel it after a second.
//    void Parent(...) {
//      thread::Fiber child(absl::bind_front(Child, ...));
//      absl::SleepFor(absl::Seconds(1));
//      child.Cancel();
//      child.Join();  // Wait for "child" to observe cancellation and complete.
//    }
//
//    // The child code that loops doing stuff until it is cancelled
//    void Child(...) {
//      while (!thread::Cancelled()) {
//        DoSomeWork();
//      }
//    }
//
// A child may want to detect cancellation while reading from some channels.  To
// support this, fibers provide a Case (see thread::OnCancel) that can be
// included in a Select statement (in addition to the ability to pass Reader or
// Writer objects to Select).  The Case becomes ready when cancellation is
// requested.
//
// Example: read and process data from a channel until cancelled.
//
//   void Process(thread::Reader<Value>* r, ...) {
//     Value v;
//     bool ok;
//     thread::CaseArray cases =
//         {r->OnRead(&v, &ok), thread::OnCancel()};
//
//     while (thread::Select(cases) == 0 && ok) {
//       Process(v);
//     }
//   }
//
// Note that since cancellation is automatically propagated to the entire
// sub-tree of fibers, a fiber that is just waiting for child fibers to finish
// does not need to have any special cancellation handling.  It is up to the
// code running in the child fibers to stop in response to the cancellation,
// which will automatically allow the parent to finish. This feature should
// allow most code that uses fibers to automatically be cancellation aware
// without requiring any custom cancellation handling code.
//
// Parallelism
// -----------
// The parallelism of the fiber's tree determines the parallelism of the
// children. For example, if ServerHandler() above runs within the scope of an
// inbound Stubby4 RPC, the above fibers will typically run in parallel (exactly
// how many run at once depends on Stubby's configuration). But if
// ServerHandler() is run from the scope of main, the above fibers may or may
// not run in parallel since main has an unspecified parallelism.
//
// You can use thread::NewTree() to create a fiber tree with parallelism
// specified by thread::TreeOptions().
