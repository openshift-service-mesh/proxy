// A BoundedBundle is a wrapper of thread::Bundle
// which limits the number of fibers that will be alive at any
// given time. This is useful for flow control: if you have N tasks to execute
// in parallel, and N is unbounded or known to be much larger than the number of
// CPUs available, you can use a BoundedBundle to limit the number of fibers
// that will be alive at any given time.

// All operations on the bundle are run in fibers that are
// descendants of the fiber that created the bundle and will therefore
// observe cancellation.
//
//
// Example:
//     thread::BoundedBundle bundle(42);
//     for (const auto& element : some_vec) {
//       bundle.Add([&element]() {
//               -- do something with element
//
//               -- some_vec.size() could be much more than 42, but at most 42
//               -- fibers will be alive at any given time
//       });
//     }
//     bundle.JoinAll();
//
// BoundedBundle limits the number of work items currently added to
// an internal thread::Bundle. The caller of Add() blocks for previous work
// items to finish to avoid exceeding the configured limit.
