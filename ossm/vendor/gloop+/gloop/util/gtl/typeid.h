// This file defines two ways to get a unique integer from any type.
//
// It's useful when you want to store several values indexed by type,
// but don't want to use static variables in those types. The Type
// does not need to be complete. WARNING: The values returned are only valid
// for a single run of a binary, and should never be saved or sent over the
// wire. For cross-process, cross-machine consistency, see a related mechanism
// implemented in //gloop/util/registration/typename.h.
//
// These IDs serve a similar purpose to the typeid() operator but does
// not require RTTI, can only operate over static types, and doesn't
// provide as much information. You may be tempted to explicitly
// specialize this class to provide other per-type data. Probably
// don't. It's probably cleaner to define another structure to hold
// your data. In any case, this code will need to be refactored
// before it's ready to be explicitly specialized.
//
// Call it as:
//
//   FastTypeId<Type>()  // If you don't need contiguous/small values, or
//   TypeIdInSet<SetKeyType>::get<Type>()  // if you do.
//
// The FastTypeId-variant is fully evaluated at compile/link-time, resulting in
// a pure constant in your final binary, while the TypeIdInSet-variant uses a
// singleton and counter to guarantee small/contiguous values.
//
// Note that there is a third (deprecated) variant:
//   TypeId::get<Type>()
//
// This variant uses TypeIdInSet<void> internally, so gives you the drawback of
// using the TypeIdInSet-variant, while at the same time not giving you the
// guarantee of contiguous values, assuming another library in your binary might
// use that call as well.
