//////////////
// Data layout

// For the experiments that led up to this design, see
// experimental/users/amc/instant/.
//
// This implementation shrinks the input array by rearranging the data
// into three sections using two levels of indirection.  There is an
// index section, which refers to a main section, which refers to a
// lexicon section.
//
// The index section starts at a base offset (recorded in the
// decode_key) and grows forward.  The lexicon section starts at the
// base offset and grows backward.  The main section starts at the end
// of the index section and grows forward.
//
//     lexicon_section <base_offset> index_section main_section
//
// The main section is a sequence of bit-fields, one field for each
// position in the original raw array, in the same order.  The lexicon
// section contains four lexicons numbered 0 to 3, any of which can be
// empty, each of which is a sequence of entries (which are bit-fields).
// The index section is a sequence of block descriptors, one for each
// 128-position block of the input array.  Here is a slightly expanded
// view of the whole shrunk array (asterisk means zero-or-more):
//
//     lex3 lex2 lex1 lex0 <base_offset> block_descriptor* main_field*
//
// The base offset, and the offsets in the block descriptors (see
// below), are measured in bits from the start of the shrunk array.
// These offsets are currently 51-bit unsigned numbers, but if this
// becomes too limiting, things could be rearranged to allow 64-bit
// offsets, at a cost of 1/2 bit per input position.
//
// The bit at offset n is defined to be bit n%64 of shrunk_array[n>>6],
// where bit 0 means the least significant bit.  This definition makes
// the native byte-order irrelevant.

// Block descriptor:
//
// Neither the input array nor the main section is block-oriented; both
// are sequences without natural boundaries.  Only the index section is
// block-oriented.  Each block descriptor describes a conceptual block
// of 128 fields of the main section (which correspond to a conceptual
// block of 128 positions of the input array).  A block descriptor is
// composed of five uint64_t elements:

// element 0: profile tag map for the first quarter of the block
// element 1: profile tag map for the second quarter of the block
// element 2: bits 13..63: offset of the start of the second quarter
//                         of the block in the main section
//            bits  0..12: size (in bits) of the second and third
//                         quarters of the block in the main section
// element 3: profile tag map for the third quarter of the block
// element 4: profile tag map for the fourth quarter of the block

// The number of input positions is typically not a multiple of 128, and
// therefore the last block descriptor typically contains some unused
// tags.  Tags in element 4 corresponding to non-existent positions are
// used for the main section, which is allowed to start at an unaligned
// offset.  For example, if the number of positions is 125, then the
// last 6 bits of element 4 will not be needed for tags, and the main
// section can start 6 bits before the end of the block descriptor.  If
// the tags in element 3 are all unused, main section begins immediately
// after element 2.

// Profile tag map:
//
// Each profile tag map contains 32 two-bit tags, one for each position
// in the quarter-block.  Each tag indicates which of four profiles
// (numbered 0 to 3) is used to encode that position.

// Profile:
//
// A profile consists of a main field width and a lexicon entry width.
// If a position is encoded using profile i, whose main width is M and
// whose lexicon width is L, that means the position occupies an M-bit
// field in the main section, which is an index to an L-bit entry in
// lexicon i, which contains the original input value for the position.
// Exception:  If the lexicon width is zero, then the main field is a
// literal value, not a lexicon index.

// Example:
//
// Supposed we want to look up the value at position 221.  The index
// section looks like:

//     block descriptor for positions 0..127
//     block descriptor for positions 128..255
//     block descriptor for positions 256..383
//     ...

// Zoom in on that second block descriptor:

//     profile tag map for positions 128..159
//     profile tag map for positions 160..191
//     offset & size
//     profile tag map for positions 192..223
//     profile tag map for positions 224..255

// The offset tells us where position 160 starts in the main section.
// The size tells us how many bits are used by positions 160..223 in the
// main section.  Therefore offset + size is the start of position 224
// in the main section.  We're looking for position 221, so we need to
// subtract the widths of positions 223, 222, and 221.
//
// Zoom in on the third profile tag map (for positions 192..223):

//     most significant                              least significant
//     00 10 01 01 11 10 00 00 11 ... 11 10 00 11 10 01 01 00 01 11 10
//     ^^position 223                                   position 192^^

// Position 221 uses profile 1.  Suppose our table of profile widths is:

//     main width 0 = 5   lexicon width 0 = 22
//     main width 1 = 8   lexicon width 1 = 19
//     main width 2 = 20  lexicon width 2 = 0
//     main width 3 = 9   lexicon width 3 = 11
//                        lexicon width 4 = 14 |
//                        lexicon width 5 = 18 | ignore 4..6 for now
//                        lexicon width 6 = 23 |

// So position 221 has an 8-bit field in the main section, which points
// to a 19-bit entry in lexicon 1.  Where does the main field start?
// Positions 223, 222, and 221 use profiles 0, 2, and 1 respectively,
// so in the main section they use 5, 20, and 8 bits, respectively,
// which is 33 bits total, so we can subtract 33 bits from the offset
// for position 224 (found above) to get the offset for position 221,
// and read the 8 bits starting there to get the value of the main field
// for position 221.  Let's say that value is 105.  If the lexicon width
// were zero, we would be done, and 105 would be the final value.  But
// the lexicon width is 19, not zero, so 105 is an index into lexicon 1.
// This example will be continued below.

// Lexicons
//
// Lexicons 0, 1, and 2 contain as many entries as possible, given
// the corresponding main field width, which allows the start of each
// lexicon to be calculated given only the base offset and the profile
// widths.  The last lexicon (lexicon 3) is free to have fewer entries
// than profile 3's main width would allow.  Another unique feature of
// the last lexicon is that it is subdivided into four sub-lexicons with
// four separate widths, either all zero or all nonzero.  So although
// there are four main widths numbered 0 to 3 (like the profiles they
// belong to), there are seven lexicon widths numbered 0 to 6, with
// lexicon widths 3 to 6 all being used by lexicon 3.  In particular,
// lexicon width (3 + j%4) is used for entry j of lexicon 3.  The
// intention is that the last profile be used for the largest lexicon,
// where its additional degrees of freedom (four widths and arbitrary
// size versus one width and power-of-two size) can have the most
// impact.

// Example (continued):
//
// Profile 0 has a main width of 5 and a lexicon width of 22, therefore
// lexicon 0 is 32 * 22 = 704 bits, implying that lexicon 1 starts
// 704 bits below the base offset and grows downward.  Every entry of
// lexicon 1 is 19 bits wide, and we need entry 105, so we read 19 bits
// starting 704 + 105*19 = 2699 bits below the base offset, and the
// result is the value of position 221.
//
// Now suppose position 221 had used profile 3 rather than profile 1, so
// that it was entry 105 of lexicon 3 that we were looking for.  Zoom in
// on lexicon 3:

//     entry 6  entry 5  entry 4  entry 3  entry 2  entry 1  entry 0
// ... 18 bits  14 bits  11 bits  23 bits  18 bits  14 bits  11 bits

// The entries of lexicon 3 cycle through four widths (lexicon widths
// 3..6), and each cycle contains 11 + 14 + 18 + 23 = 66 bits.  So
// entries 0..103 contain 104/4 * 66 = 1716 bits.  Entries 104 and 105
// contain 11 + 14 = 25 bits.  Lexicons 0, 1, and 2 contain 32*22 +
// 256*19 + 1048576*0 = 5568 bits.  So we read 14 bits starting 5568 +
// 1716 + 25 = 7309 bits below the base offset.

// Omitted sections:
//
// The index section can be omitted (to speed decoding or to improve
// compression for data that doesn't benefit from it), in which case the
// last profile (profile 3) is used for all positions.  When the index
// section is present, the base offset must be a multiple of 64, so that
// the block descriptors are aligned with the array elements.
//
// The lexicon section can be omitted simply by forcing all the lexicon
// widths to zero.

// Decode key:
//
// The decode key contains the base offset, the four main widths,
// and the seven lexicon widths, in an array of two 64-bit unsigned
// integers, as follows:

// decode_key[0]: bits  0..6:  main width 3
//                bits  7..12: lexicon width 6 (minus one)
//                bits 13..63: base offset
//
// decode_key[1]: bits  0..6:  main width 0
//                bits  7..13: lexicon width 0
//                bits 14..20: main width 1
//                bits 21..27: lexicon width 1
//                bits 28..34: main width 2
//                bits 35..41: lexicon width 2
//                bits 42..48: lexicon width 3
//                bits 49..54: lexicon width 4 (minus one)
//                bits 55..60: lexicon width 5 (minus one)
//                bits 61..62: reserved (must be zero)
//                bit  63:     index_section_present flag

// Main widths and lexicon widths both range from 0 to 64 inclusive.  To
// help enforce the requirement that the four widths of lexicon 3 are
// all zero or all nonzero, and to avoid having a width straddle the two
// integers, and to leave a couple bits reserved for future extension,
// lexicon widths 4, 5, and 6, if they are nonzero, are decremented
// before being stored, so that they fit in 6 bits each.  Lexicon width
// 3 still occupies 7 bits so the decoder can distinguish the all-zero
// case from the all-one case.  The fields are ordered so that when the
// caller chooses complexity 1, the only two nonzero fields (base offset
// and main width 3) are both in decode_key[0], so the caller need not
// preserve decode_key[1], which is guaranteed to be zero.

// Complexity parameter:
//
// The decoder performs at most one memory fetch from each section
// (index, main, lexicon).  The index and lexicon sections are optional,
// and the complexity parameter bounds the number of fetches by
// eliminating one or both of those sections.  At complexity 3, both are
// allowed; at complexity 1, neither is allowed; at complexity 2, either
// is allowed, but not both.
