Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library is a secure, fast and lightweight library of building blocks for cryptography, highly-optimized for various Intel® CPUs.

## Key Features
The library provides a comprehensive set of routines commonly used for cryptographic operations, including:
 - Post-Quantum Cryptography Functions:
    - Hash-based signature algorithms (XMSS, LMS)
    - Key encapsulation mechanism (ML-KEM)
 - Symmetric Cryptography Primitive Functions:
    - AES (ECB, CBC, CTR, OFB, CFB, XTS, GCM, CCM, SIV)
    - SM4 (ECB, CBC, CTR, OFB, CFB, CCM)
    - TDES (ECB, CBC, CTR, OFB, CFB)
    - RC4
- One-Way Hash Primitives:
    - SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
    - SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, SHAKE128 and SHAKE256
    - MD5
    - SM3
- Data Authentication Primitive Functions:
   - HMAC
   - AES-CMAC
- Public Key Cryptography Functions:
   - RSA, RSA-OAEP, RSA-PKCS_v15, RSA-PSS
   - DLP, DLP-DSA, DLP-DH
   - ECC (NIST curves), ECDSA, ECDH, EC-SM2
- Multi-buffer RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, x25519, SM2, SM3, SM4, etc
- Finite Field Arithmetic Functions
- Big Number Integer Arithmetic Functions
- PRNG/TRNG and Prime Numbers Generation

## Reasons to Use Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library

- Optimized for different Intel CPUs and instruction set architectures (including hardware cryptography instructions support):
    - Intel® Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (Intel® SSE2)
    - Intel® SSE3
    - Intel® SSE4.2
    - Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions (Intel® AVX)
    - Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (Intel® AVX2)
    - Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512)
- Configurable CPU dispatching for the best performance
- Kernel mode compatibility
- Thread-safe design
