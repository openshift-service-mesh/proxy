# Clippy

[Clippy][clippy] is a tool for catching common mistakes in Rust code and improving it. An
expansive list of lints and the justification can be found in their [documentation][docs].

## Setup

Simply add the following to the `.bazelrc` file in the root of your workspace:

```text
build --aspects=@rules_rust//rust:defs.bzl%rust_clippy_aspect
build --output_groups=+clippy_checks
```

This will enable clippy on all [Rust targets](./rust.md).

Note that targets tagged with `no-clippy` will not perform clippy checks.

To use a local `clippy.toml`, add the following flag to your `.bazelrc`. Note that due to
the upstream implementation of clippy, this file must be named either `.clippy.toml` or
`clippy.toml`. Using a custom config file requires Rust 1.34.0 or newer.

```text
build --@rules_rust//rust/settings:clippy.toml=//:clippy.toml
```

## Rules

- [rust_clippy](./rust_clippy.md) — Rule that runs `clippy-driver` against a Rust target and
  fails the build on lint findings. Attach one per target for explicit gating.
- [rust_clippy_aspect](./rust_clippy_aspect.md) — Aspect form of the above. Attach in
  `.bazelrc` (as shown in Setup) to run clippy across every Rust target in the build.
- [rust_clippy_test](./rust_clippy_test.md) — Test rule that reports clippy findings as
  test failures, useful in CI where a failing test is more visible than a failing build.
